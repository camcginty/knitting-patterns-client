## List of unsolved problems
  Future versions will include updates to:
    * Improved visual display.
    * Input the size of the grid you want to use for your pattern
    * Add a color selector so patterns can have many colors instead of only black and white.
    * Let visitors view thumbnails of patterns and their creator's name.


## Story about development planning/obstacles:
I wanted to make an app to assist with my knitting. In the past, I used graph paper to draw patterns, but I was limited by the size of the paper and making changes to th epattern after could be difficult. My main goal was to be able to make any size pattern I wanted and save them for future use.
My proof of concept was easy. I started with creating a 2x2 grid to make sure I got the basics working. Once I tried to scale it up, I ran into problems with the display. I had trouble getting each line to be the correct number of squares each time. And sometimes the squares would be scrambled when viewing a pattern at a later time. I tried several approaches to fixing these issues and settled on a "works for now" solution while I continue to work on a better and more permanent fix.
